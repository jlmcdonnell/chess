This is a simple Chess app I wrote test out Jetpack Compose. The goal was to implement something that felt as good or better than chess.com's app.

## Features
- Entirely compose driven board UI with drag & drop interaction
- [Stockfish 15](https://stockfishchess.org/) embedded to enable play against bots 
- https://github.com/bhlangonijr/chesslib used for movement & game rules
- Online mode
- Pieces taken from https://chess.com, sounds taken from https://lichess.org

## TODO

- Game archive and variants viewer
- Historic moves whilst in-game
