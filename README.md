Simple chess app using Jetpack Compose

- Entirely compose driven board UI with drag & drop interaction
- Stockfish 15 embedded
- https://github.com/bhlangonijr/chesslib used for movement & game rules
- Pieces taken from chess.com, sounds taken from lichess.org

## TODO

- Animate opponent pieces into position instead of teleporting
- Game archive and variants viewer
- Historic moves
- Everything else
